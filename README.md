Colonist
========

Compile time class discovery framework for JVM languages.

Why?
----

Sometimes you may want to find all classes that match some condition and perform
an action on every such class. On Android it could be quite a challenging task
since there's no documented way to enumerate all classes from an APK using
reflection. Moreover, solving this problem with reflection would affect 
application performance negatively.

Colonist offers a solution by moving class discovery step to the compile-time.
And at the runtime you just need to iterate through a precomputed list of
classes and do whatever you need.

Usage
-----

### Attention

The library is experimental. Its API isn't stable yet and may change dramatically.

### Configuration

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    jcenter()
  }

  dependencies {
    classpath 'com.joom.colonist:colonist-gradle-plugin:0.1.0-alpha7'
  }
}

// For Android projects.
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'com.joom.colonist.android'

// For other projects.
apply plugin: 'java'
apply plugin: 'com.joom.colonist'
```

### Colonies

Colonist requires three steps to be defined in order to describe how to deal
with classes (settlers): selection, production, and acceptance. And that's what
a colony is for.

The colony is an annotation that, in its turn, is annotated with `@Colony`
meta-annotation. Moreover, the colony must be annotated with another three
annotations that define steps of settlers discovery.

#### Selection

The first step in class discovery is selection that specifies a common attribute
classes must have to be discovered. At the moment there're just two ways to
select classes:

- `@SelectSettlersByAnnotation` discovers all classes annotated with a specified
annotation class.
- `@SelectSettlersBySuperType` selects all classes that extend a given class. 

#### Production

The second step is production and it specifies what the discovered classes are
going to be converted to:

- `@ProduceSettlersAsClasses` is an identity conversion. In other words it
produces the same classes it receives.
- `@ProduceSettlersViaCallback` invokes a user-defined callback for every
discovered class and uses its return values as the result.
- `@ProduceSettlersViaConstructor` instantiates classes using their default
constructors. The default constructors for all discovered classes **must exist**. 

#### Acceptance

The third and the last step is acceptance and it's responsible for collecting
the results of the previous two steps (i.e. settlers):
- `@AcceptSettlersAndForget` just ignores all the settlers. This behavior may be
useful if settlers are autonomous and just need to be created in order to do
their stuff.
- `@AcceptSettlersViaCallback` invokes a user-defined callback for every 
produced settler.

#### All together

It's much easier to understand what's going on using a simple example. Let's
write a class that finds all plugins and initializes them. And we'll start with
a plugin interface:

```kotlin
interface Plugin {
  fun initialize(context: Context)
}
```

We'll be looking only for plugin classes annotated with a particular annotation
that we need to define:

```kotlin
@Target(AnnotationTarget.CLASS)
annotation class AutoPlugin
```

Then we need a couple of plugin implementations that we'll use in our sample.
Let's make it a bit more complex and also create a base plugin implementation: 

```kotlin
abstract class BasePlugin(private val name: String) : Plugin {
  override fun initialize(context: Context) = println("Initialize $name")
}

@AutoPlugin
class Plugin1 : BasePlugin("Plugin1")

@AutoPlugin
class Plugin2 : BasePlugin("Plugin2")
```

Now we need to define a colony annotation that will discover and instantiate all
existing plugins:

```kotlin
@Colony
@SelectSettlersByAnnotation(AutoPlugin::class)
@ProduceSettlersViaConstructor
@AcceptSettlersViaCallback
@Target(AnnotationTarget.CLASS)
annotation class PluginColony
```

Some entity should be responsible for plugin initialization so let's assume we
have a plugin manager:

```kotlin
@PluginColony
class PluginManager(private val context: Context) {
  init {
    Colonist.settle(this)
  }

  @OnAcceptSettler(colonyAnnotation = PluginColony::class)
  fun onAcceptPlugin(plugin: Plugin) {
    plugin.initialize(context)
  }
}
```

After running the application you'll the following lines in the log but the order may differ:
```
Initialize Plugin1
Initialize Plugin2
```
